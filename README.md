## Title -Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction 
Concrete is most important matarial in civil Engineering. Knowing the compressive strength of concrete is very imoprtant when constructing a building or a bridge. Using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.

## Problem Statement-
Predicting Compressive strength of gives Concrete.We will try out many models and pick the best one to make our predictions.

## Objective- 
1)Analyze the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset and build a Machine Learning model to predict the quality
2)Find Best Fit Model for Concrete Compressive Strength dataset

## Business pov-
Using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.

## Name of Attribute-
In this Dataset several features they are affect the quality of concrete. So we discuss brief of each feature:
1)Cement 2)Blast_furnace_slag 3)Fly_ash 4)Water 5)Superplasticizer 6)Coarse_aggregate 7)Fine_aggregate 8)Age 9)concrete_compressive_strength

## Attribute Information -
1) Cement: a substance used for construction that hardens to other materials to bind them together.¶
2) Blast_furnace_slag: Mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.
3) Fly_ash: coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases.
4) Water: It is used to form a thick paste.
5) Superplasticizer: used in making high-strength concrete.
6) Coasese_aggregate: prices of rocks obtain from ground deposits.
7) Fine_aggregate: the size of aggregate small than 4.75mm.
8) Age: Rate of gain of strength is faster to start with and the rate gets reduced with age.
9) Concrete_compressive_strength: Measurement unit of concrete strength.

## Future Scope -

concrete is made up of three basic components Water, aggregate, and portland cement. We know quality is the most important property for material used in building, if the quality of concrete is less then the build can’t stable but if we use the best quality concrete then the building is stable. analyze the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset and build a Machine Learning model it helps to predict the quality of concrete
